Waves Module - Class 10 Interactive Educational Module
Overview

This project is an interactive educational module built in React for Class 10 students to learn about waves.
It includes simulations, animations, and interactive controls to help students understand transverse and longitudinal waves through real-life examples such as water waves, light waves, sound waves, and rope pulses.

Features

Transverse & Longitudinal Waves

Visualize how the medium moves (perpendicular or parallel to wave propagation)

Selectable Wave Examples

Water surface waves, light waves, rope pulses, sound waves, seismic P-waves, slinky compression

Interactive Sliders

Adjust Amplitude, Frequency, and Wavelength in real-time

Play/Pause & Grid Overlay

Dynamic Canvas Animation

Smooth wave motion using HTML5 Canvas and requestAnimationFrame

Responsive Design

Works on different screen sizes with a 16:9 aspect ratio canvas
